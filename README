This package is for implementing so-called virtual hosts in a
mechanism similar to that of hunchentoot's easy-handlers.


Arghh... what a mess. I'm getting lost in a maze of metaness. Perhaps
some documentation about what I'm trying to do will help me straighten
things out.

The general idea is that I would like to create a "virtual host"
mechanism such that a single server (which listens on a single port,
as is the Hunchentoot design) can serve different content depending on
the host name used in the http request so that, for example,
http://host1.bogus.com/ and http://host2.bogus.com/ could serve up
different pages.


Virtual hosts - It is desirable that a single virtual host can handle
multiple host names such that, for instance, http://www.bogus.com/ and
http://bogus.com can point to the same page.

Servers - Hunchentoot servers listen on a single port and field
requests. One can either use the default hunchentoot server or extend
the hunchentoot server class with a specialized virtual-host-server.

Mapping between virtual hosts and servers - It is desirable to be able
to run individual virtual hosts on multiple hosts. How do we go about
doing this?

Applications - The reason behind doing all of this is so that one can
set up multiple applications on a single set of servers. How do we
manage these applications? How do the applications get information
about which (virtual) host they are running on?
